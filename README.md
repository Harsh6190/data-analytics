## Customer Churn Prediction for E-commerce Company

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict customer churn (customers who stop using the service). Predicting churn allows businesses to proactively target these customers with retention campaigns.

*Project Structure:*

* data: This folder contains the e-commerce customer dataset (replace with your actual file name).
* notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis (cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation).
* requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries required for the project (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

*Getting Started:*

1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/customer-churn-prediction.git
   
2. Install required libraries:
   bash
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Download an e-commerce customer dataset (ensure it is anonymized if obtained from a third party). Place the CSV file in the data folder.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder using your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.

*Notebooks:*

* data_cleaning.ipynb: This notebook cleans and prepares the customer data for analysis.
* exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: This notebook performs exploratory data analysis to understand customer demographics, purchase history, and churn trends.
* feature_engineering.ipynb: This notebook creates new features based on existing data to potentially improve model performance.
* model_building_and_evaluation.ipynb: This notebook builds a Logistic Regression model for churn prediction, evaluates its performance on unseen data, and analyzes feature importance.

*Feel free to explore and modify these notebooks to experiment with different data cleaning techniques, feature engineering approaches, and machine learning models.*

*Further Enhancements:*

* Explore other classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) and compare their performance.
* Implement a web application that allows users to input customer data and predict churn probability.

I hope this project helps you gain practical experience with customer churn prediction using Python and machine learning!
